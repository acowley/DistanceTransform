An N-dimensional distance transform that computes the Euclidean
distance between each element in a discrete field and the nearest cell
containing a zero.

The algorithm implemented is based off of Meijster et al., *"A general
algorithm for computing distance transforms in linear time."* Parallel
versions of both the Euclidean distance transform and squared
Euclidean distance transform are also provided.
